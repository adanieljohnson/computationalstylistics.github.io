The Computational Stylistics Group has always had an ambition to understand – on a deeper level – the methodological assumptions behind text-analysis techniques. Consequently, most of the studies conducted by the members of the Group are somewhat methodology-centric. Below, we present a selection of the studies that, as we believe, contribute to the state-of-the-art stylometric methodology. Two of these contributions, namely [Bootstrap Consensus Networks](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/06_bootstrap_networks/) and [Rolling Stylometry](https://computationalstylistics.github.io/projects/05_rolling_stylometry/), are featured in separate posts.
