This 3-year project, founded by the [National Science Centre](https://ncn.gov.pl/?language=en) (2013/11/B/HS2/02795), entitled “Przebiegi zmian gramatycznych i leksykalnych w historii języka polskiego - metody korpusowe i kwantytatywne w językoznawstwie diachronicznym” (“Course of grammatical and lexical changes in the history of the Polish language - corpus-driven quantitative methods in diachronic linguistics”), is aimed at an investigation of grammatical and lexical changes, focusing on trends and dynamics of changes in the middle and modern Polish period. What makes this approach innovative is an extensive use of methods elaborated by quantitative and corpus linguistics. A purpose-built diachronic corpus of Polish will be statistically analysed in order to observe various changes in the course of development of the Polish language. We also intend to date the changes and determine their exact character.

The second objective (considered even more important by the applicants) is to elaborate statistical tools, which allow for description of the course of linguistic changes, their dynamics, and particularly their parallel coocurrences. The applicants aim at developing a methodology, which will combine a diachronic large-scale analysis with an automatic identification of the specific grammatical and lexical features responsible for a language change.
