This is an on-going project or, to be precise, a selection of studies in stylometric methodology, conducted by the members of the Computational Stylistics Group. So far, this is a blob rather than a regular post â€“ more stuff will be added here, time permitting.



## Sample size in stylometry


## Do we need the most frequent words?


## How to choose training samples?


## Bootstrapped Delta


## Austenizig Trollope
