This 5-year project entitled “Development of Computational Chemical Linguistics and its Applications to the Efficient Planning of Multistep Chemical Syntheses” and founded by the [National Science Centre](https://ncn.gov.pl/?language=en) (2014/12/W/ST5/00592), is a joint initiative of three research teams, based at the Institute of Organic Chemistry (Polish Academy of Sciences), the Institute of Mathematics (University of Warsaw) and at the Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences), representing three different disciplines: chemistry, computer sciences, and linguistics. 

The project addresses one of the greatest and outstanding challenges of modern chemistry –
namely, the use of computers to design optimal, multistep chemical pathways leading to lifesaving drugs, pigments or dyes, complex natural products, and many more. Our proposal
unites the efforts of Poland’s best chemists, computer scientists and linguistics experts to challenge this prevailing view of chemistry and demonstrate – both in silico and through experimental validation – that by uniting the tools of computational linguistics (or corpus linguistics), data mining, machine learning, and algorithm theory, it is possible to teach computers chemistry to the level of top-notch organic chemists and then use these computers to plan complex synthetic transformations.


## chemical “keywords”? 

Interested in identifying molecule fragments that are “meaningful”? Want to see how keyword extraction works outside the text analysis world? This paper describes how such corpus-linguistic concepts can be extended to chemistry based on characteristic “chemical words” that span more than traditional functional groups and, instead, look at common structural fragments molecules share. Using these words, it is possible to quantify the diversity of chemical collections/databases in new ways and to define molecular “keywords” by which such collections are best characterized and annotated:
