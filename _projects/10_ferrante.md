Elena Ferrante is an Italian writer who does not exist as a person, at least a person bearing that name. Still, someone obviously has been writing her novels. In 2016, an Italian investigative journalist followed the novels’ royalties and announced that they seem to be going to Anita Raja, the Italian translator from the German of Christa Wolf. Raja said this was not true, but things became quite heated also because her husband is Domenico Starnone, a Neapolitan writer (as “Ferrante” always seemed to be) – he has already been mentioned as another possible suspect.

To finally solve this riddle – a very major one in modern Italian literature – the University of Padova, represented by Profs Arjuna Tuzzi and Michele Cortelazzo, organized a workshop called “Drawing Elena Ferrante’s Profile”, which took place in September 2018; they also provided a 150-book electronic corpus of Ferrante and many other suspect Italian writers. Two members of CSG were invited to the workshop together with eight other stylometrists from several countries. Despite using different methods and approaches to authorship attribution, all fingers pointed to Domenico Starnone. Judge for yourselves: in a network analysis of the above-mention Italian corpus, only two authors clustered away from the rest, and these two clustered together: Ferrante and Starnone, in very strong support of the Starnone hypothesis. At the same time, it is worth noting that the translations by Raja are nowhere close to Ferrante.

Yet this creates a problem: what if Raja is not visible in this attribution because all we have to go by in establishing her stylometric thumbprint are her translations of another person’s work rather than her _real_ personal traits. This cannot be answered with any certainty. There is still another possibility: Starnone and Raja are in this together, so an attempt was made to look into individual texts by Ferrante to look for possible Raja/Starnone fragments. While the above caveat still remains – Raja’s “signal” can only be represented by her translations of Christa Wolf – the clearly uniform appearance of that of Starnone as the strongest stylometric component over the entire length of a novel by Ferrante (the diagram below shows this for _L’Amica geniale_) brings us perhaps a little closer to some certainty.

The Padova workshop and its findings made quite a stir in Italy and abroad. [_La Repubblica_](https://napoli.repubblica.it/cronaca/2017/09/09/news/le_prove_sono_nella_letteratura_elena_ferrante_e_starnone_-174989746/?refresh_ce) reported at one and at length, and so did local Padovan news. TA NEA, a major Greek newspaper, went so far as to publish a [picture](www.patakis.gr/images/files/1167464.pdf) of some of the researchers involved (including both CSG members). Italian state TV, RAI Cultura, recorded [an interview](www.filosofia.rai.it/articoli/rybicki-la-text-analysis-e-le-radici-della-letteratura/40413/default.aspx); another appeared in the Dutch [De Volkskrant](https://www.volkskrant.nl/cultuur-media/hoe-een-poolse-wetenschapper-het-grootste-literaire-raadsel-binnen-vijf-minuten-oploste~b227f47b/); and Poland’s _Gazeta Wyborcza_ also ran a broader [story](biqdata.wyborcza.pl/biqdata/7,159116,22829674,jak-rozpracowano-elene-ferrante-slowo-po-slowie.html) on the recent Polish contributions in stylometry. Even later, Treccani reviewed the post-workshop (open-access!) volume edited by Arjuna and Michele.
Both Raja and Starnone continue to negate all responsibility. Starnone even said, “I. AM. NOT. ELENA. FERRANTE.”
