<h2 id="abstract">Abstract</h2>

<p>This little project started from the following thought experiment: while most state-of-the-art stylometric approaches aim at broadening the scope of the analysis according to the “distant reading” paradigm, do we really understand what a single text is? In other words the question here was, what about applying a microscope perspective, rather than the usual large-scale analysis approach? This thinking led to introducing <strong>a new method</strong>, supported with compact visualization, that tries to look inside a text represented as a set of linearly sliced chunks, in order to test their stylistic consistency. Since it is based on the idea of moving slowly through a text to be stylometrized, it has been named <strong>Rolling Stylometry</strong>.</p>

<p>The following description is but an appetizer. A quick start, supplemented by applicable/reusable snippets of code, can be found in <a href="/blog/rolling_stylometry/">this blog post</a>. For a detailed explanation of the method’s theoretical assumptions, features, and implementation refer to the following paper:</p>

<h2 id="motivation">Motivation</h2>

<p>Sequential analysis is a very attractive way of assessing linear phenomena. The concept of the moving window is particularly important to measure given elements in their sequential order. It has been introduced to stylometry and extended by van Dalen-Oskam and van Zundert in their study on the medieval Dutch poem titled <em>Roman van Walewein</em> (van Dalen-Oskam and van Zundert, 2007). Other notable approaches to visualize stylistic shifts using moving windows include papers on Middle Dutch rhyme words (Kestemont, 2010), on three disputed English prose texts (Burrows, 2010), and on <em>The Tutor’s Story</em> by Kingsley and Mallet approached with t-tests (Hoover, 2011). Recently, Rolling Delta has been applied to examine collaborative works by Joseph Conrad and Ford Madox Ford (Rybicki et al., 2014).</p>

<p>The Rolling Stylometry method is based on the above approaches. Its general idea is very simple: a text to be analyzed (e.g., an anonymous text to be attributed) is chunked into equal-size blocks (partially overlapping). Then, instead of attributing the text in its entirety, the goal is to perform an independent similarity test for each chunk, and to inspect the results as a sequence of ordered stylistic signals. Arguably, any classification method can be combined with this procedure. So far, however, support vector machines (SVM), nearest shrunken centroids (NSC), and Delta in its classical Burrowsian flavor have been implemented (Eder, 2015).</p>

<h2 id="an-example">An example</h2>

<p>The method is designed to detect stylistic takeovers. An example is <em>The World’s Desire</em>, a classic fantasy novel written collaboratively by Henry Rider Haggard and Andrew Lang in 1890. It is a story of the hero Odysseus, who returns home to Ithaca after his journey: instead of finding his home at peace, however, he is involved in several new adventures. The plot of the novel as well as its mythological background was set by Lang, while Haggard – the author of several appreciated adventure novels – contributed his imagination and style. It is assumed that Haggard reworked Lang’s drafts and actually wrote most of the novel except the first four chapters, which were written entirely by Lang.</p>

<div class="col three caption">

</div>

<p>A simple experiment involving a reference corpus of eight novels by Haggard and eight by Lang corroborates the hypothesis. In Fig. 2, the results of the Rolling Classify technique applied to <em>The World’s Desire</em>, using 100 MFWs, have been shown. One can easily observe a stylistic takeover in the first part of the text. The break point takes place in the middle of the sixth chapter. Also, some Lang’s sections seem to appear in the central part of the novel. However, these apparent Lang’s sectors evaporate when a different MFW strata is tested.</p>

<div class="col three caption">
    Fig. 3. Sequential analysis of <i>The World’s Desire</i> by Haggard and Lang: Rolling SVM and 1000 MFWs.
</div>

<p>For 500 MFWs, Haggard’s signal shows up for a short moment in the fists chapters of the novel. When 1000 MFWs are taken into consideration (Fig. 3), the distinction between two authorial voices in the sixth chapter is the only takeover that can be observed.</p>

<p>The method has been successfully applied in a number of studies by the members of the Group. Probably the most spectacular is <a href="/blog/harper-lee/">a short study on Harper Lee</a> that has been featured in the <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/data-miners-dig-into-go-set-a-watchman-1437096631">Wall Street Journal</a>, and then evolved into a regular <a href="/projects/09_harper-lee/">research project</a>. Another example is a study on Elena Ferrante as a “virtual author”, having a different voice from the actual person behind the pseudonym (Eder, 2018).</p>
