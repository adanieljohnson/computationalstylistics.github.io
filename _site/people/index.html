  <article class="post-content People clearfix">
    <div class="img_row_people">
    <img class="col one left" src="/assets/img/maciej_eder.png" alt="" title="example image" />
    <span class="col two left"><strong>Maciej Eder</strong>: Director of the <a href="https://test.ijp.pan.pl/en/">Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences)</a>, and Associate Professor at the Institute of Polish Studies at the Pedagogical University of Kraków, Poland. He is interested in European literature of the Renaissance and the Baroque, classical heritage in early modern literature, and scholarly editing (his most recent book is a critical edition of 16th-century Polish translations of the <i>Dialogue of Salomon and Marcolf</i>). For at least a couple of years, interested in computer-based stylometry and non-traditional authorship attribution. His work is now focused on a thorough re-examination of current attribution methods and applying them to non-English languages, e.g. Latin and Ancient Greek.</span>

<div class="img_row_people">
    <img class="col one left" src="/assets/img/jan_rybicki.png" alt="" title="example image" />
    <p class="col two left"><strong>Jan Rybicki</strong>: Assistant Professor at the Institute of English Studies, Jagiellonian University, Kraków, Poland; he also taught at Rice University, Houston, TX and Kraków’s Pedagogical University. His interests include translation, comparative literature and humanities computing (especially stylometry and authorship attribution). He has worked extensively (both traditionally and digitally) on Henryk Sienkiewicz and the reception of the Polish novelist's works into English, and on the reception of English literature in Poland. Rybicki is also an active literary translator, with more than twenty translated novels by authors such as Coupland, Fitzgerald, Golding, Gordimer, le Carré or Winterson.</p>

    <p class="col two left"><strong>Joanna Byszuk</strong>: a PhD candidate and a full-time researcher at the Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences). Her interests include computational stylistics and discourse analysis, in particular their methodology, limitations, and application to audiovisual and historical works. She frequently works on examining authorship in texts written in collaboration and on cross-lingual problems, and has her ongoing project applying stylometry to the study of authorship patterns in audiovisual works.</p>

<div class="img_row_people">
    <img class="col one left" src="/assets/img/kestemont_pers.jpg" alt="" title="example image" />
    <p class="col two left"><strong>Mike Kestemont</strong>: Assistant Professor at the University of Antwerp (<a href="http://www.mike-kestemont.org" target="_blank">personal webpage</a>). His interest lies with the computational text analysis of historic texts, in particular medieval texts from western Europe. Much of his publications are concerned with stylometric authorship attribution.</p>

He graduated in theoretical physics and in English studies (specialised in translation) and is a novice translator. He conducts research on methods of data analysis, neuroscience, as well as stylometry and quantitative linguistics. Currently, his main interests are interdisciplinary applications of mathematical tools (analysis of complex networks, analysis of time series, random matrix theory) and machine learning.</p>
