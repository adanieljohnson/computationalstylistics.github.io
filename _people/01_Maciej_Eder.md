Director of the [Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences](https://ijp.pan.pl/en/), and Associate Professor at the Institute of Polish Studies at the Pedagogical University of Kraków, Poland ([personal webpage](http://maciejeder.org/)). He is interested in European literature of the Renaissance and the Baroque, classical heritage in early modern literature, and scholarly editing (his most recent book is a critical edition of 16th-century Polish translations of the <i>Dialogue of Salomon and Marcolf</i>). For at least a couple of years, he’s been interested in computer-based stylometry and non-traditional authorship attribution. His work is now focused on a thorough re-examination of current attribution methods and applying them to non-English languages, e.g. Latin and Ancient Greek.
