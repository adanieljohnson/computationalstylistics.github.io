Computational Stylistics Group is a cross-institutional research team focused on computer-assisted text analysis, stylometry, authorship attribution, sentiment analysis, and the like stuff. The research projects conducted by the team members could be described as an intersection of linguistics, literary criticism, and computer science – however the best name here would be “Digital Humanities”. The group is based mostly in Kraków, at the Institute of Polish Language (Polish Academy of Sciences), but also at the Jagiellonian University and the University of Antwerp. 

Even if the Group has been involved in several research projects (some of them are listed on this website, on the [Projects]({{ site.baseurl }}/projects) subpage), it is probably known – at the first place – for the R package [stylo](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/stylo/index.html), which is a comprehensive collection of functions written in the programming language R, for performing a variety of experiments in computational stylistics. More information about the package can be found [here](https://github.com/computationalstylistics/stylo). Also, please check the [discussion list](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/computationalstylistics) dedicated to various issues in stylometry and beyond. 

The Computational Stylistics Group is a member of the [Federation of Stylometry Labs](https://stylometry.org/) (FoSL), and closely collaborates with the [COST Action “Distant Reading”](https://www.distant-reading.net/), as well as the [Digital Literary Stylistics](https://dls.hypotheses.org/) Special Interest Group (SIG) affiliated with the [Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations](https://adho.org/). Being based mostly in Krakow, it is also a part of the [DH Kraków](https://twitter.com/dhkrakow) initiative.
